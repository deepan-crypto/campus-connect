# Project Bug Fixes and MongoDB Migration

## Completed Fixes

### Backend Issues Fixed
- ✅ Added missing `@prisma/client` dependency to backend package.json
- ✅ Moved prisma directory from root to backend/ for proper organization
- ✅ Generated Prisma client with `npx prisma generate`
- ✅ Fixed port 4000 conflict by killing existing process
- ✅ Backend now runs successfully on http://localhost:4000

### Frontend Issues Fixed
- ✅ Confirmed supabase.ts usage has been removed from frontend
- ✅ Frontend dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ Frontend runs successfully on http://localhost:5173

### Database Migration
- ✅ Prisma schema already configured for MongoDB (provider = "mongodb")
- ✅ DATABASE_URL environment variable configured for MongoDB
- ✅ Prisma client generated and working

## Project Status
- ✅ Backend server running on port 4000
- ✅ Frontend server running on port 5173
- ✅ MongoDB configured as development database via Prisma
- ✅ Supabase.ts removed from frontend
- ✅ All major components (Auth, Feed, Connections, Comments) appear functional

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Test full application functionality (login, posts, connections, etc.)
- [ ] Verify MongoDB connection works in development
- [ ] Check for any runtime errors in browser console
- [ ] Test socket.io real-time features
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints work correctly

## Notes
- Prisma is still used in backend for MongoDB ORM (as requested for development database)
- Supabase usage has been completely removed from frontend
- Project structure is now properly organized with backend/ containing its own prisma setup
